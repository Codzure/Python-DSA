# Big O notation is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity. 
# It is a member of a family of notations invented by Paul Bachmann, Edmund Landau, and others, collectively called Bachmannâ€“Landau notation or asymptotic notation.

# Big O notation is used in computer science to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm.
# It is often used to analyze the time complexity of algorithms and the space complexity of algorithms.
# The time complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input.
# The space complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of memory space taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input.
# Big O notation is used to describe the upper bound of the time complexity or space complexity of an algorithm.
# It provides an upper bound on the growth rate of the algorithm's running time or space requirements.
# Big O notation is used to classify algorithms based on their performance characteristics.
# It is used to compare the efficiency of different algorithms and to analyze the scalability of algorithms.
